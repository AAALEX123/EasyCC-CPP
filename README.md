EasyCC C++ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amirbawab/EasyCC-CPP.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/amirbawab/EasyCC-CPP)
============

EasyCC C++ (Easy Compiler Compiler) is a library allowing users to easily develop their own programming language. The project does not require wrting any line of code for the lexical and syntax analysis phases. The configurations of the latters are provided as JSON files to the library. Adding the logic for a programming language is done by simply registering semantic action handlers in order to gradually build the structure of the input and eventually generating output code.

To learn more about how it works, read the documentation and/or check the step by step tutorial below.

### Difference between EasyCCDev and EasyCCPro
Both libraries use the same Lexical and Syntax algorithms, and switching from one library to another requires minor changes. 
* EasyCCDev (EasyCC development mode) takes the JSON files as arguments in the final executable. This is useful during the development phase because the program does not need to be recompiled to apply changes in the JSON files.
* EasyCCPro (EasyCC production mode) takes the JSON files as arguments to the CMake. The compile process for your program will be composed of two steps. First is embedding the JSON files into the executable. Second is compiling your program with the generated files.

### Learn by examples
#### Calculator programming language
This example is a step by step tutorial on how to use EasyCC-C++ to build a very simple programming language. The program will read an input file and produce an output file. The input file is composed of integer numbers (operands) and arithmetic symbols (operatos). The output produced is the mathematical result of the calculation written in the input file.

#### Step 1: Create a "lexical_state_machine.json" file
Lexical state machine converts a sequence of characters into lexical tokens. For instance, one can define a sequence of consecutive positive number as an `integer` token. Following this rule, the lexical analyzers will replace positive numbers in the input file, such as `1`, `123`, etc..., by the lexical token `integer`, then move to the next sequence of characters and apply the corresponding rule. Lexical tokens generated by the lexical analyzer are stored in a list, required later by the syntax analyzer.  

A lexical state machine can easily grow, even for a simple programming language like the one covered in this tutorial. Therefore, a graphical tool has been developed in order to faciliate this task. The web based tool uses forms and a JavaScript based graph to populate the state machine. Once the state machine is complete, the data can be exported in JSON format and served as a first configuration input to the EasyCC C++ library.
